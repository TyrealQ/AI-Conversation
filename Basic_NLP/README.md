# NLP with Hugging Face Transformers

Basic_NLP.ipynb provides a collection of code and guides for basic NLP applications using Hugging Face's **Transformers** library. It includes implementations for **sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), text summarization, and topice modeling** with pre-trained transformer models and evaluation techniques.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Compare transformer-based models like RoBERTa and modernBERT with the lexicon-based VADER approach.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extract and classify entities such as names, organizations, and locations.
- **Text Summarization**: Generate concise summaries using pre-trained models.
- **Topice Modeling**: Identify hidden themes in a collection of documents.
